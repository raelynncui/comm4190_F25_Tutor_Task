# Testing LLMs as an Oil Painting Tutor

## Overview  
In this project, I compare the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4o as an oil painting tutor across three different prompts: an **unstructured** one, a **structured** one optimized for better tutoring (based on Mollick’s *Structured Tutor Prompt*), and a **modified** version that I created by incorporating improvements to the structured prompt based on my own experience.  

Overall, I found that the **structured prompt** produced a much more engaging and effective tutoring experience. Its responses were concise, incorporating questions that felt purposeful and guided me through the learning process step by step. The **unstructured prompt**, on the other hand, often led to long and unfocused responses that didn’t feel interactive. My **modified prompt** built on the strengths of the structured one, adding better resilience against distractions and negative learner behavior while keeping the positive, tutor-like qualities such as encouragement, recaps, and clear lesson structure.
